 **SQLite with Python** 
A basic sales data analysis was performed by creating and connecting to a local SQLite database using Pythonâ€™s built-in sqlite3 module. A simple sales table was either created, containing fields such as product, quantity, and price. 
Using SQL queries, we calculated the total quantity sold and total revenue for each product by aggregating the data with SUM() and grouping by product name. The query results were loaded into a pandas dataframe for further manipulation and display.

**Matplotlib** used to visualize the sales performance with a bar chart showing revenue by product. This allowed for a quick visual insights of products that generated the most income. Overall, SQLite was effective for quick local data analysis and visualization, making it ideal for small-scale projects or prototypes without the need for a full database setup.
